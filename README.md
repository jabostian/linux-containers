# Containers on IBM Z
This is a repository for information about containers and the mainframe.  This
information is built around Docker on IBM Z, and in most cases, it applies to
both z/OS through the IBM zCX environment, and Linux on Z.

There are no images available here.  This is a repository for source code and
instructions on how to build your own images for deployment.

Key directories include:

- _**examples**_ - Dockerfiles, READMEs, and tools related to specific containerized
  workloads.
- _**howto**_ - things to know about building and deploying containers on IBM Z, and
  IBM z/OS Container Extensions (IBM zCX).
